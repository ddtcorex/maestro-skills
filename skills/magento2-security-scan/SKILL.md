# Magento 2 Security Scanner

This skill performs security scanning for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance issues.

## Govard-Native Audit Coverage

`govard audit run` executes PHPCS and PHPStan through Govard's pinned lint
toolchain image — it covers coding-standard and static-analysis findings only.
As of Govard v1.64.0 no `security` audit check exists:
`govard audit run --checks security` fails with "audit check ... is not
implemented". The lint run does include a pub/media PHP guard since v1.64.0 — every PHP file
under `pub/media` is flagged (`M2-LINT-MEDIA`) — so a lint pass also covers that specific
file-drop attack surface, but it is still not a vulnerability scan. Run this skill's manual
checklist yourself and treat `govard audit run --checks lint` as the shared lint gate. Never
present a lint-only pass as a security verdict.

## Related Skills

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Load `magento2-dev-core` first — this skill scans for violations of the security patterns it defines (escaping, discouraged functions, ObjectManager misuse), and its patterns are what you fix findings with.

Part of the QA trio with `magento2-linter` (style/static analysis) and `magento2-performance-audit` (runtime/infrastructure). Re-check API/resolver-specific findings against `magento2-backend-dev`.

## Vulnerability Categories

### 1. Injection Vulnerabilities

| Type | Pattern | Severity | Code |
|------|---------|----------|------|
| SQL Injection | Direct SQL with user input | Critical | M2-SEC-001 |
| XSS (Reflected) | Unescaped user input in output | High | M2-SEC-003 |
| XSS (Stored) | Unescaped database content | Critical | M2-SEC-002 |
| Command Injection | System command execution with user input | Critical | M2-SEC-004 |

Full scale and code catalogue: `magento2-dev-core/references/severity-and-codes.md`.

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Admin path changed | Check env.php for custom admin path |
| 2FA enabled | Check admin/twofactor module |
| Password hashing | Verify EncryptorInterface usage |
| Session security | Check cookie configuration |

### 3. Data Exposure

```bash
# Check for exposed sensitive files
curl -I https://store.test/app/etc/env.php
curl -I https://store.test/var/log/system.log
curl -I https://store.test/.git/config

# Expected: All should return 403 or 404
```

### 4. CSP Configuration

```bash
# Check CSP settings
govard sh -c "bin/magento config:get cms/wysiwyg/use_static_urls"
govard sh -c "bin/magento config:get design/content-security_policy/enable_content_security_policy"
```

## Scanner Commands

### PHP Security Checker

```bash
# Install security tools
composer require --dev magento/security-package --no-interaction

# Run Magento security scan
govard sh -c "vendor/bin/magento-security-scanner scan ./app/code/Vendor/Module"
```

### Dependency Audit

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
govard sh -c "composer audit --no-interaction"

# Check for outdated packages with security fixes
govard sh -c "composer outdated --direct --format=json | jq '.[] | select(.[\"security-update\"]) | .name'"
```

### File Permission Check

```bash
# Check Magento file permissions
find var/ pub/static pub/media -type f -not -perm 0644 -ls
find var/ pub/static pub/media -type d -not -perm 0755 -ls
find app/etc -type f -not -perm 0640 -ls
```

## Scoping

The "Quick Security Scan" greps default to a full module path
(`app/code/Vendor/Module`). Given an explicit file list instead, loop over it
the same way:

```bash
for f in app/code/Vendor/Module/Controller/Index/Index.php app/code/Vendor/Module/Model/Foo.php; do
  grep -Hn "\$_GET\|\$_POST\|\$_REQUEST\|ObjectManager::getInstance\|eval(" "$f"
done
```

`magento2-code-review` derives this file list from a git diff or an MR fetch
and calls this skill with it directly — the git/glab mechanics themselves
live there, not here.

### Environment-level checks — scope boundary

Authentication & Authorization, Data Exposure, and CSP Configuration
(sections 2-4 above) are not file-list-scoped at all — they check the
running environment (`env.php`, a live URL, `bin/magento config:get`), not
specific files. They cannot run against a PR/MR diff or remote fetch (no
checked-out environment to query there) and, even at project/module scope,
run once per audit rather than once per file. `magento2-code-review`
states explicitly in its Coverage note whether these ran (project/module/
theme scope, live environment available) or were skipped (PR/MR scope, or
no environment access this session) — this is never left for whoever's
running the review to decide silently.

## XSS Prevention Checklist

- [ ] All output escaped with `$escaper`
- [ ] `escapeHtml` for HTML content
- [ ] `escapeHtmlAttr` for attributes
- [ ] `escapeJs` for JavaScript strings
- [ ] `escapeUrl` for URLs
- [ ] Form keys in all POST forms
- [ ] No direct `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST` usage

## CSRF Protection

### Verified Patterns

```php
// Form with form key
<form action="<?= $escaper->escapeUrl($action) ?>" method="post">
    <?= $block->getBlockHtml('formkey') ?>
</form>

// AJAX with form key
$.ajax({
    url: url,
    type: 'POST',
    data: {
        form_key: $.cookie('form_key'),
        ...data
    }
});
```

### Verify Admin Protection

```bash
# Check if admin form key validation is active
govard sh -c "bin/magento config:show admin/security/use_form_key"
# Expected: 1
```

## Rate Limiting

```bash
# Configure rate limiting
govard sh -c "bin/magento config:set web/secure/open_restriction_enabled 1"
```

## Security Headers

Check in nginx/Apache config or .htaccess:

```
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## PCI-DSS 4.0 Checklist (E-commerce)

From April 2025, payment pages require:

- [ ] `unsafe-eval` CSP disabled
- [ ] `unsafe-inline` CSP disabled
- [ ] No inline scripts in payment forms
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ enforced

## Quick Security Scan

Run this for a rapid security assessment. **On DSH**, prefer the bounded workspace search tool
over shell loops — one call per pattern, no silent truncation:

```
maestro_search_files { pattern: "execute|fetchAll|->select\\(|insertOnDuplicate", glob: "*.php", path: "app/code/Vendor/Module" }
```

(Exclude ORM-layer hits — Collection/Repository/ResourceModel class files — when judging results;
the tool reports path:line:text, capped and flagged when truncated.)

Elsewhere, use the equivalent grep pipelines:

```bash
# 1. Check for SQL in code
grep -r "execute\|fetch\|fetchAll\|select\|insert\|update\|delete" \
    app/code/Vendor/Module --include="*.php" | \
    grep -v "Collection\|Repository\|ResourceModel"

# 2. Check for superglobals
grep -r "\$_GET\|\$_POST\|\$_REQUEST" \
    app/code/Vendor/Module --include="*.php"

# 3. Check for ObjectManager
grep -r "ObjectManager::getInstance" \
    app/code/Vendor/Module --include="*.php"

# 4. Check for code evaluation functions
grep -r "eval" app/code/Vendor/Module --include="*.php"
```

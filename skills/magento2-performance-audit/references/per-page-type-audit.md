# Per-Page-Type Audit (homepage, product, category)

Full detail for Workflow step 3.

A single-page spot check isn't representative — different page types have very different bottleneck shapes (a CMS-heavy homepage vs. a layout-heavy product page vs. a grid-heavy category page). Audit at least one of each of these three page types, using both the HTML profiler (`references/html-profiler-audit.md`) and the query log (`references/database-query-profiling.md`) together, with `full_page`, `block_html`, and `layout` caches **disabled** so you're measuring true cache-miss cost (the worst case every real cache-miss/deploy/flush pays) rather than a warm-cache request that tells you almost nothing.

**Sample 3 URLs per page type, not 1 — except homepage, which is usually singular** (unless the store has multiple storefront views, in which case sample those too). One category and one product tells you *a* number; it can't tell you whether that number is representative of the type or an artifact of the one page you happened to pick, and it can't catch a bug whose cost only becomes visible at scale (see "Interpreting results correctly" below — it needs at least 3 differently-sized samples of the same type to work at all). Three samples per type is enough to show a pattern without turning the audit into a full crawl.

## 0. Pick genuinely representative pages first

Before measuring anything, verify the specific URLs you're about to test aren't degenerate cases — this is the single easiest way to get a misleading audit.

> **Check for a DB table prefix before running any query below.** Magento 2 supports an optional
> table prefix (`db.table_prefix` in `app/etc/env.php`, set via `bin/magento setup:install
> --db-prefix=...` or inherited from a prefixed remote sync) — every bare table name in this file
> (`catalog_category_product`, `catalog_category_entity`, `catalog_product_website`,
> `url_rewrite`, `eav_attribute`, etc.) assumes no prefix. Check first:
> ```bash
> govard sh -c "grep -A1 \"'table_prefix'\" app/etc/env.php"
> ```
> If it's non-empty, prepend it to every table name in every query in this file (and anywhere else
> in this audit you write ad hoc SQL against app tables — this does not apply to MySQL system
> tables/variables in `references/database-query-profiling.md`'s slow-query checks, or to
> `EXPLAIN`ing SQL already captured from the query log, since that SQL already has the real prefix
> baked in). A query against the bare name on a prefixed install fails loudly ("table doesn't
> exist"), which at least isn't silent — but don't just retry with a guessed prefix, confirm it
> from `env.php` first.

```bash
# Category: pull a spread of product counts, not just one — you want a small, a medium,
# and a large category (not the single largest root category, which is its own edge case)
govard db query "SELECT category_id, COUNT(*) cnt FROM catalog_category_product GROUP BY category_id ORDER BY cnt LIMIT 200"
# then pick 3 across that range, e.g. one ~10, one ~50-100, one ~200+

# Category: a candidate's product-count row says nothing about whether it's actually enabled —
# an inactive category still has real catalog_category_product rows and a resolvable
# url_rewrite, so it looks like a perfectly good pick right up until the curl to it 404s.
# Check is_active for every candidate before treating a 404 as "picked the wrong URL":
govard db query "SELECT cce.entity_id, cv.value AS is_active FROM catalog_category_entity cce
  LEFT JOIN catalog_category_entity_int cv ON cv.entity_id=cce.entity_id
    AND cv.attribute_id=(SELECT attribute_id FROM eav_attribute WHERE attribute_code='is_active'
      AND entity_type_id=(SELECT entity_type_id FROM eav_entity_type WHERE entity_type_code='catalog_category'))
    AND cv.store_id=0
  WHERE cce.entity_id IN (<candidate ids>)"

# Product: confirm each candidate is assigned to a website (unassigned products 404 / aren't routable)
govard db query "SELECT * FROM catalog_product_website WHERE product_id=<id>"

# Product: also watch for url_rewrite entries that 301/302 redirect elsewhere (including,
# in some data sets, out to a live production domain) — follow redirects manually first,
# don't blindly -L through them into a request against someone's production site
curl -sk -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} -> %{redirect_url}\n" https://store.test/<product-url>.html
```

Pick 3 categories spanning small/medium/large product counts (not the single largest root category, not an edge case, confirmed `is_active`), and 3 products that each resolve 200 directly — varying product type (simple/configurable) if the catalog has both.

## 1. Set up the uncached measurement environment

```bash
# Acquire the session-owned query-log lock first; keep audit_token for every capture and teardown.
# Full lock semantics and owner checks: references/database-query-profiling.md.
audit_token="$(date +%s)-$$"
govard sh -c "lock=var/debug/.performance-audit.lock; mkdir \"\$lock\" || { echo 'SKIPPED: query-log capture already owned'; exit 1; }; printf '%s\\n' '$audit_token' > \"\$lock/owner\""
govard sh -c "test \"\$(cat var/debug/.performance-audit.lock/owner 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; bin/magento dev:profiler:enable html"
govard sh -c "test \"\$(cat var/debug/.performance-audit.lock/owner 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; bin/magento dev:query-log:enable --include-all-queries=true --include-call-stack=true --query-time-threshold=0"
govard sh -c "test \"\$(cat var/debug/.performance-audit.lock/owner 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; bin/magento cache:disable full_page block_html layout"
govard sh -c "test \"\$(cat var/debug/.performance-audit.lock/owner 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; bin/magento cache:flush"

# One throwaway homepage request first (discard its output/log) — this lets config/eav/
# compiled_config caches rebuild after the flush. Confirm it's actually 200 before proceeding —
# a broken warmup means every capture after it is measuring a failure, not a page.
curl -sk -H "Accept: $ACCEPT" -A "$UA" -o /dev/null -w "warmup: %{http_code}\n" https://store.test/
govard sh -c "test \"\$(cat var/debug/.performance-audit.lock/owner 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; : > var/debug/db.log"
```

> **This one homepage warmup is not enough on its own — every sample URL needs its own warmup too.** It only rebuilds *global* caches (config/eav/compiled_config); it does nothing for the layered-nav attribute metadata, category-specific EAV lookups, and other page-type-specific data that only get computed and cached the first time that *specific* URL is actually requested. Visiting the homepage first does not pay that cost on a category or product page's behalf — each one pays its own first-visit tax independently, regardless of what else was hit before it. Step 2 below folds a per-URL warmup into the same loop as the real capture — don't skip it and reuse just the homepage warmup for all 7 pages.

## 2. Capture each page type separately

For each of the (typically 7: 1 home + 3 category + 3 product) URLs: **warm that specific URL first** (throwaway request, discard — see the callout above), then clear the query log, fetch with a realistic `Accept`/User-Agent (see warning in `references/database-query-profiling.md`), save the HTML (for the profiler table) and a copy of the query log, then clear the log again before the next page — **checking the HTTP status every time**, since a non-200 response still produces a plausible-looking HTML file and query log that will silently corrupt every number downstream if you don't check:

```bash
declare -A urls=(
  [home]="/"
  [category_small]="/<small-category-url>.html"
  [category_medium]="/<medium-category-url>.html"
  [category_large]="/<large-category-url>.html"
  [product_1]="/<product-url-1>.html"
  [product_2]="/<product-url-2>.html"
  [product_3]="/<product-url-3>.html"
)
for name in "${!urls[@]}"; do
  url="${urls[$name]}"
  # Per-page warmup (discard) — this specific URL's own first-visit cold cost, not covered
  # by the single homepage warmup in step 1.
  curl -sk -H "Accept: $ACCEPT" -A "$UA" -o /dev/null -w "warmup ($name): %{http_code}\n" "https://store.test$url"
  govard sh -c "test \"\$(cat var/debug/.performance-audit.lock/owner 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; : > var/debug/db.log"
  code=$(curl -sk -H "Accept: $ACCEPT" -A "$UA" -o "${name}.html" -w "%{http_code}" "https://store.test$url")
  echo "$name ($url): HTTP $code"
  [ "$code" = "200" ] || echo "  ^ NOT 200 — discard this capture, do not analyze ${name}.html/${name}.db.log"
  govard sh -c "test \"\$(cat var/debug/.performance-audit.lock/owner 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; cat var/debug/db.log" > "${name}.db.log"
  govard sh -c "test \"\$(cat var/debug/.performance-audit.lock/owner 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; : > var/debug/db.log"
done
```

> **Keep storefront HTTP requests on the host; use `govard sh` only for container-local log work.** The store domain normally resolves through the host proxy/TLS setup, while the application container has different DNS and network routes. A curl moved into `govard sh` can therefore fail with `exit status 7`, return HTTP `000`, or reach an unrelated `localhost` service even when the host request works. Do not work around that by calling PHP-FPM on port 9000: FastCGI is not HTTP, so `docker exec <web> curl http://<php>:9000/` is not a page capture.
>
> The capture boundary is deliberate: host-side `curl` warms and requests each storefront URL; `govard sh -c` clears, snapshots, and reads `var/debug/db.log` inside the application container. Treat a curl transport error, HTTP `000`, or empty response as an invalid page capture, not a zero-query result. Record the URL and error, fix the host DNS/hosts or proxy path, then repeat that page in isolation before including it in a comparison. Do not move curl into the container merely to avoid the host problem. If the host cannot reach the declared URL during this session, mark that page `Skipped: host cannot reach <url> (<error>)`; the profiler and query-log artifacts for that failed request are not evidence. Keep the second pass on the same host URLs and in the same order once reachability is restored.

After this loop completes, re-run it a second time in full (same URLs, same order) without an additional flush and diff the counts against the first pass — per-URL-warmed numbers should match exactly. If any page still doesn't reproduce, treat it per item 4 in `references/database-query-profiling.md` (re-run that one page in isolation before trusting the number).

Analyze each page's `*.html` for its profiler table (see `references/html-profiler-audit.md` for what each column means and how to trace custom-code cost) and each `*.db.log` for total query count, repeated/duplicate query shapes (candidate N+1s), and — using the call stack in each entry — the exact file:line responsible for the worst offenders.

## 3. Always restore state afterward

```bash
govard sh -c "lock=var/debug/.performance-audit.lock; test \"\$(cat \"\$lock/owner\" 2>/dev/null)\" = '$audit_token' || exit 1; bin/magento cache:enable full_page block_html layout && bin/magento cache:flush && bin/magento dev:profiler:disable && bin/magento dev:query-log:disable && : > var/debug/db.log && rm \"\$lock/owner\" && rmdir \"\$lock\""
```

Don't leave a target environment with caches disabled and full query logging on — this is a diagnostic state, not a normal running state, and matters especially if the target is shared with other developers or is staging rather than a disposable local box.

## Interpreting results correctly

- **A `curl` wall-clock time captured while the profiler and call-stack query logging are both active is not representative of real page load time** — the instrumentation itself (especially `--include-call-stack=true`, which walks and serializes a full PHP stack on every single query) adds real overhead, sometimes an order of magnitude. Use this setup to get query counts, repeated shapes, and file:line traces — not to report "the homepage takes N seconds." For actual load-time numbers, use the Core Web Vitals Audit (`references/core-web-vitals.md`) on the same pages with instrumentation off.
- **Query count vs. query time are different signals.** A small/fast local DB can show trivial total query *time* (tens of ms) even when the query *count* is 3–5x over budget — don't dismiss a high count just because local timing looks fine; the count is what will hurt on production's real network round-trips and larger tables.
- **Not every slow section benefits from the caches you just disabled.** `layout` cache only skips re-parsing/merging layout XML — it does NOT skip instantiating the PHP block objects for every declared block (that happens fresh on every request regardless of cache, since live objects can't be cached across requests). If a page's time is dominated by layout *generation* rather than block *rendering*, re-enabling `layout`/`block_html` cache won't fix it — the real lever is reducing how many blocks/modules contribute to that page's layout.
- **A query shape repeated with near-identical counts across all 3 page types** (not just one) is a strong signal it comes from a globally-rendered block (header/footer/cart-drawer widget), not something page-specific — prioritize fixing that over a page-specific N+1, since it's paid on every single page view site-wide.
- **A query shape whose count scales with the grid size, across your 3 category (or product-list) samples, is a separate signal from the one above — and needs at least 3 differently-sized samples to see at all.** Compare total query count and specific shape counts across the small/medium/large category samples: a shape whose count tracks the product count roughly 1:1 (e.g. ~10 on the 10-product category, ~200 on the 200-product one) is a per-item loop that isn't using the collection's already-batched data — a real N+1 that gets *worse as the catalog grows*, not a fixed per-page cost. This is exactly the kind of bug a single-category spot check cannot reveal: on a 9-product category it might add an invisible ~10 queries; on a 200-product one it's ~1,000+. Trace it with a call-stack-enabled re-capture of the largest sample (see the two-pass note in `references/database-query-profiling.md`) — common culprits are a rich-snippets/structured-data block, a review-summary widget, or a price/label renderer that calls a per-product model method (e.g. `ReviewSummary::load($id)`, a pricing `Price::getValue()` behind a custom `around` plugin) instead of pre-loading via the collection (`addSummaryData()`, `addFinalPrice()`, etc.).
- **This query count is only the initial server-rendered request** — a page that looks cheap here can still defer real work to its own client-side AJAX/GraphQL calls (see `references/ajax-load-audit.md`), which this count never sees. Don't report a low DB query count as "this page is lightweight" without also checking what it fetches after the HTML loads.
- **The same two cross-page-type signals apply to the HTML profiler, not just the query log** — a slow block/template timer repeated across all 7 pages is a global-block problem (fix once, site-wide impact); one whose `Cnt`/`Time` scales with the small/medium/large category samples is a per-item render loop that gets worse as the catalog grows. See `references/html-profiler-audit.md` for how to read the profiler table and trace either pattern to custom code.

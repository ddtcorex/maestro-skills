- dispatching-parallel-agents
- executing-plans
- finishing-a-development-branch
- receiving-code-review
- requesting-code-review
- subagent-driven-development
- systematic-debugging
- test-driven-development
- using-git-worktrees

Local additions on top of the fork (not upstream content):

  mapping.
- A short fork-provenance note and an un-namespaced invocation note in
  `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md`.

Sync policy: refresh the forked skills with `scripts/sync-superpowers.sh`
(pulls upstream and preserves `dsh-tools.md`; the fork-provenance note in
`using-superpowers/SKILL.md` is re-applied by hand during review because the
script only snapshots the files in its `PRESERVE` list). Do not hand-edit the
forked skill bodies; upstream is their single source of truth.
